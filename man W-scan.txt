       -l TYPE
              choose LNB type by name (DVB-S/S2 only) [default: UNIVERSAL],
              "-l?" for list of known LNBs.

       -D Nc  use DiSEqC committed switch position N (N = 0 .. 3)

       -D Nu  use DiSEqC uncommitted switch position N (N = 0 .. 15)

       -p <file>
              use DiSEqC rotor Position file

       -r N   use Rotor position N (N = 1 .. 255)

       -P     ATSC scan: do not use ATSC PSIP tables for scan (PAT and PMT only)
